Title: Idea - our Mission

The main goal of that spec is to be able to have a obapi client who could download all of my invoices each month without any human intervention (or minimal).

There is some solutions for that, for example woob.tech or cozy.io but each time the provider change his website they have to rebuild the dedicated web scapper script.

**obapi** reverse the problem with a solution at the source: providers could offer a unified way of accessing invoices. That's all.
