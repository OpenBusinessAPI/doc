Title: Idea - Mission
---

The main goal of that spec is to be able to have a obapi client who could download all of my invoices each month without any human intervention (or minimal).

There is some solutions for that, for example woob.tech but each time the provider change his website you have to rebuild your web scapper script.

obapi reverse the problem with a solution at the source: providers could offer a unified way of accessing invoices. That's all.
