# OpenBusinessAPI - Documentation

## The problem to solve

Every provider has his own website where you must go to download your invoices (and more). Each month you loose your time to log-in to that website and download one PDF file.

Then the main goal of this project is to purpose an open specification for one unified API for every compatible website.
